## Rshiny application
Developed R Shiny app to explore mRNA data and enable interactive analyses.
Incorporated multiple tabs dedicated to functionalities such as, sample information review, counts matrix visualization,
differential expression, correlation network analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis.
This application was tested with data from this research article: Salachan, P. V., & Sørensen, J. G. (2022). Molecular mechanisms underlying plasticity in a thermally varying environment. Molecular ecology, 31(11), 3174–3191. https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.16463
